# Exercise 1: Setting up an Ethereum wallet

In this exercise we will be creating an Ethereum wallet which will be running in your browser. With it you will be able to manage it, sign transactions, send and receive ether, manage tokens, etc.

NOTE: For obvious reasons, in this exercise we will be using the Ethereum [Sepolia testnet](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/) and not the mainnet.

## Instructions

We will be using [**MetaMask**](https://metamask.io/) to create a Wallet and connect to Ethereum blockchain:

* **Pre-requisite**: Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, or Edge)
* Go to MetaMask site: https://metamask.io/download.html
* Install the Chrome extension
* Create a new wallet by clicking on the MetaMask icon (a fox on the top right hand of your browser)
  * You will be asked to note down some words. These are your recovery words in case you lose your wallet.
* Write down your wallet address in this [file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/to16PN6uUVASLwVLGVNhqB4oGFBjVa4XR4bIIVxehkCYUA/edit?usp=sharing) to get some test ETH from the teacher.


* Add the "Sepolia Test Network" in MetaMask:
  * Click on the network dropdown at the top of MetaMask
  * Click "Add network" or "Show test networks" to enable test networks
  * Select "Sepolia" from the list of test networks
* Get some test ETH from a Sepolia faucet:
  * https://sepoliafaucet.com/ (requires Alchemy account)
  * https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia (requires Infura account)
  * https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/ (PoW faucet, no account needed)
  * **TIP**: If you have trouble with the faucets, feel free to ask the teacher for some test ETH
* Send some test ETH to your colleagues!!!
